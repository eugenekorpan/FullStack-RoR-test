FullStack-RoR-test
==================

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to create a small rails app that does the following. 

You have college students that like to play video games. 

Sometimes they get bored with the game, start hating it. Sometimes they love the game and keep on playing it.

Given a student, find out which video games is the student playing.

Given a video game, find out which students played that video game.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Someone should be able to answer the 2 basic questions above using the application you create. 
We would like you to add something of your own to the application. 

What other questions can you make the application answer? 

Or how could you make the application useful to other applications that might be interested in this data you're collecting? 

What if you found a similar service, how could you integrate their data with yours?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, please send me two links: heroku and github so we can review the code and play with the test app.


## What We Are Looking For

* How does git and github factor into your development process?

* How do you use tests to develop your application?

* How do you handle error conditions? 

* How do you simulate error conditions in your test.

* Was it easy to lurk and understand how the app was progressing?


* Were holes in testing documented and understood?

* Was your app easy to "use" at every stage?

* How did automation play a part in your work?
